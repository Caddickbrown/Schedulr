# Schedulr

Daily Planning Optimization Tool

## Overview

This tool generates optimal daily plans that balance Qty, Picks, and Hours based on target limits. It prioritizes orders by due date while ensuring a balanced utilization across all three metrics.

## Setup

1. Extract data from your Daily Planning Template:
   ```bash
   python extract_data.py
   ```
   This creates:
   - `daily_plan_data.csv` - Order data
   - `daily_plan_limits.txt` - Limits for Qty, Picks, and Hours

2. Run the optimizer:
   ```bash
   # Single day planning
   python daily_plan_optimizer.py
   
   # Multi-day planning (e.g., 3 days)
   python daily_plan_optimizer.py 3
   ```

## Output

### Single Day Planning
The tool generates:
- `daily_plan_suggestions_BVI.xlsx` / `.csv` - BVI brand plan
- `daily_plan_suggestions_Malosa.xlsx` / `.csv` - Malosa brand plan

### Multi-Day Planning
For multi-day planning, the tool generates:
- `daily_plan_suggestions_BVI_<N>days.xlsx` - Excel file with separate sheets for each day (Day 1, Day 2, etc.)
- `daily_plan_suggestions_BVI_<N>days_Day1.csv`, `Day2.csv`, etc. - Separate CSV files for each day
- Same for Malosa brand

The multi-day planner balances utilization across days to ensure a similar "blend" (Qty/Picks/Hours ratios) across all days.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Reads from `daily_plan_data.csv` (extracted from your template)
2. **Optimization**: 
   - **Single Day**: Balances utilization across Qty, Picks, and Hours while:
     - Prioritizing orders by Start Date (earlier dates first)
     - Ensuring good mix of order sizes
     - Maximizing balanced utilization across all three metrics
   - **Multi-Day**: Distributes orders across multiple days while:
     - Maintaining similar utilization patterns (similar "blend") across days
     - Hitting hours target for each day (~390 hours for BVI, ~90 for Malosa)
     - Balancing order counts across days
     - Prioritizing by due date
3. **Output**: Exports selected orders to Excel/CSV format with day labels (Day 1, Day 2, etc.)
